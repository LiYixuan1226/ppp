 abstract = {Despite great advances in different software testing areas, one important challenge, achieving an automated test oracle, has been overlooked by academia and industry. Among various approaches for constructing a test oracle, machine learning techniques have been successful in recent years. However, there are some situations in which the existing machine learning based oracles have deficiencies. These situations include testing of applications with low observability, such as embedded software and multimedia software programs. There are also cases in testing embedded software in which explicit historical data in form of input-output relationships is not available, and situations in which the comparison between expected results and actual outputs is impossible or hard. Addressing these deficiencies, this paper proposes a new black box solution to construct automated oracles which can be applied to embedded software and other programs with low observability. To achieve this, we have employed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm to build a model which merely requires program's input values as well as corresponding pass/fail outcome, as the training set. We have conducted extensive experiments on several benchmarks. The results manifest the applicability of the proposed approach to software systems with low observability as well as its higher accuracy in comparison to a well-known machine learning based method.},

@article{8398472,
 abstract = {A new algebraic system, test algebra (<formula><tex>$mathsf{TA}$</tex></formula>), is proposed for identifying faults in combinatorial testing for software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. In the context of cloud computing, SaaS is a new software delivery model, in which mission-critical applications are composed, deployed, and executed on cloud platforms. Testing SaaS applications is challenging because new applications need to be tested once they are composed, and prior to their deployment. A composition of components providing services yields a configuration providing an SaaS application. While individual components in the configuration may have been thoroughly tested, faults still arise due to interactions among the components composed, making the configuration faulty. When there are <formula><tex>$k$</tex></formula> components, combinatorial testing algorithms can be used to identify faulty interactions with <formula><tex>$t$</tex></formula> or fewer components, for some threshold <formula><tex>$2 le t le k$</tex></formula> on the size of interactions considered. In general, these methods do not identify specific faults, but rather indicate the presence or absence of some faults. To identify specific faults, an adaptive testing regime repeatedly constructs and tests configurations in order to determine, for each interaction of interest, whether it is faulty or not. In order to perform such testing in a loosely coupled distributed environment such as the cloud, it is imperative that testing results can be combined from many different servers. The <formula><tex>$mathsf{TA}$</tex></formula> defines rules to permit results to be combined, and to identify the faulty interactions. Using the <formula><tex>$mathsf{TA}$</tex></formula>, configurations can be tested concurrently on different servers and in any order. The <formula><tex>$mathsf{TA}$</tex></formula> always keeps the high reduction rate of potential faulty configurations in fault location analysis.},

 abstract = {The most important quality assurance activity in flight software development is techniques used for software verification and validation. When compared with conventional software, testing of real-time systems presents unique and challenging problems since various real-time constraints of the software also need to be verified. The real-time executive software component (REX) of onboard flight software should be tested for the real-time aspects to accurately evaluate the system performance in different implementation scenarios. This paper summarizes the Independent Verification and Validation strategy followed for REX Software.},

This new experience was aimed at checking the effects of experience and training on test effectiveness and efficiency by comparing results with the former experience. The analysis of data on defect detection and test case efficiency confirms poor performance of professionals and suggests that experience and training have impact in results.},

 abstract = {Supporting sustainable development goals have become a research topic in software engineering community. Although several models and frameworks propose sustainability definitions, sustainability meaning is still emerging. Given that sustainability can be studied as a nonfunctional requirement or a quality attribute, this paper aims at exploring the sustainability concept from the software quality perspective based on approaches for classifying quality models. As a work in progress, the proposed classification scheme was piloted with papers gathered from a previously published literature review about sustainability and software quality. As a result, the classification scheme allows identifying purpose, domain, number of quality-related terms, sustainability dimensions, among others. However, other aspects, such as categorizing analysis models and validation approaches, might improve the classification scheme.},

 abstract = {Throughout history, software project management issues have been known to negatively affect the software quality and the success of this type of projects. Faced with such issues, some research have proposed solutions to improve the results in software project management in order to contribute significantly to its success. The objective of this paper is to carry out a study of the context of software project management, identifying the management areas that have been intervened with gamification strategies for software process improvement. To this end, this work proposes a systematic mapping as a research method that facilitates the identification of primary studies to analyze information and classify it based on established research criteria. We found 55 primary studies published between 2011 and 2017, on which we performed an information analysis. This analysis highlights the increase in the number of studies that use gamification as an improvement strategy for software project management processes areas. We classified the selected studies by analyzing the type of research method and the type of publication. This analysis shows that it is still an area of research in development and that it is necessary to continue working on the improvement of software project management processes with the aim of contributing to the success of its results.},

We studied software organizations to assess how they test their products and what process models they follow. The data collection was implemented as an online implementation of the survey method. Additionally the collected data was compared to our prior survey study to understand how the industry practices have changed. According to our results, the organizations have shifted towards test automation and more sophisticated testing infrastructure, they apply more agile practices even in the mission-critical software, and they have reduced the use of formal process models.},
