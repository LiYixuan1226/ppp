It includes the control functions that define the microgrid as a system that can manage itself, and operate autonomously or grid connected, and seamlessly connect to and disconnect from the main distribution grid for the exchange of power and the supply of ancillary services, including for the distribution system to which it is connected. It is recognized that microgrid components and operational solutions exist in different configurations with different implementations. The scope of this standard is to develop a set of testing procedures allowing the verification, the quantification of the performance and a comparison of the performance with expected minimum requirements of the different functions of the microgrid controller that are common to the control of all microgrids, regardless of topology, configuration or jurisdiction. It aims to present metrics for a comparison of the control functions required from both the microgrid operator and the distribution system operator. The reason for establishing a standard for testing microgrid controllers, in the context of enabling interoperability of the different controllers and components needed to operate the controller through cohesive and platform-independent interfaces, is to establish standardized testing criteria leading to procedures. This approach allows for flexibility and customization of components and control algorithms to be 16 deployed without limiting potential functionality, while ensuring minimum requirements are met. The standardization focuses on testing functional requirements, while recognizing that there are many possible hardware and software implementations of the same microgrid controller generic functions. The interoperability with various Distributed Energy Resource (DER) interfaces, and other electrical system interfaces within the microgrid should be considered. A standardized- set of testing criteria/procedures should facilitate the wide adoption standard microgrid controller functional and performance requirements by vendors and utilities, including the Distribution System Operator, for ease of interfacing with the Distribution Management System. The standard is functionality-driven and focuses on a modular approach to the implementation of the functional requirements."}, {"rank":24,"access_type":"LOCKED","content_type":"Conferences","article_number":"8314872","doi":"10.1109/STA.2017.8314872","title":"Cascade temperature control of an automotive turbocharger hot-gas test-stand","publication_number":8305014,"publication_title":"2017 18th International Conference on Sciences and Techniques of Automatic Control and Computer Engineering (STA)","isbn":"New-2005_Electronic_978-1-5386-1084-8","publisher":"IEEE","index_terms":{"ieee_terms":{"terms":["Bars","Combustion","Engines","Temperature control","Temperature measurement","Turbines"]},"author_terms":{"terms":["cascade control","fuel metering","hot gas test stand","turbocharger"]}},"pdf_url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8314872","abstract_url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=8314872","authors":{"authors":[{"full_name":"Benjamin Attard","affiliation":"Mechanical Engineering Department, University of Malta, Msida, Malta","author_order":1},{"full_name":"Mario Farrugia","affiliation":"Mechanical Engineering Department, University of Malta, Msida, Malta","author_order":2}]},"conference_location":"Monastir, Tunisia","conference_dates":"21-23 Dec. 2017","partnum":"CFP17STA-ART","start_page":"73","end_page":"79","abstract":"An experimental implementation of cascade control on the turbine inlet temperature of a turbocharger turbine is presented. The experimental setup used was a hot gas test stand developed for the determination of compressor and turbine characteristic maps of automotive turbochargers. The cascade control consisted of turbine inlet temperature as the outer loop (primary controller), while the propane buffer tank pressure feeding the burner as the inner loop (secondary controller). The propane buffer tank pressure was controlled through pulse width modulation of a solenoid valve connected to a propane cylinder. Temperature control between 500&#x00B0;C and 800&#x00B0;C (which is indicative of engine exhaust temperature) is presented along with the propane pressure control traces. The effect of the propane buffer tank size (which translates to the response time of the inner loop) is discussed. Also discussed is the inclusion of a propane orifice just upstream of the burner to match the increase/decrease rates of propane pressure in the buffer tank. This matching of pressure increase/decrease rates helped in simplifying the control scheme and removed the need for gain scheduling."},{"rank":25,"access_type":"OPEN_ACCESS","content_type":"Journals","article_number":"8315674","doi":"10.1049/oap-cired.2017.0379","title":"From simulation to reality: testing today a decentralised grid operation of the future","publication_number":8253408,"publication_title":"CIRED - Open Access Proceedings Journal","issue":"1","is_number":8315543,"volume":"2017","publisher":"IET","publication_date":"10 2017","index_terms":{"controlledterms":{"terms":["distribution networks","smart power grids"]},"uncontrolledterms":{"terms":["decentralised grid operation","distribution grid"]}},"pdf_url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8315674","abstract_url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=8315674","authors":{"authors":[{"full_name":"Elisabeth Drayer","affiliation":"University of Kassel, Germany","author_order":1},{"full_name":"Pascal Pernigotto","affiliation":"Strasbourg &#201;lectricit&#233; R&#233;seaux, France","author_order":2},{"full_name":"Juan Luis Garrote Molinero","affiliation":"Schneider Electric, UK","author_order":3},{"full_name":"Francisco Ramos","affiliation":"Schneider Electric, Spain","author_order":4},{"full_name":"Martin Braun","affiliation":"University of Kassel/Fraunhofer IWES, Germany","author_order":5},{"full_name":"Marc Lazarus","affiliation":"Strasbourg &#201;lectricit&#233; R&#233;seaux, France","author_order":6}]},"partnum":"8315674","start_page":"1153","end_page":"1157","abstract":"New ideas to operate and optimise the distribution grid of the future are regularly proposed by scientists. These new ideas are required as answer to the massive transformations that are currently happening in the distribution grid. One promising path is to move from the classic central to a more decentralised and distributed control. The work in this study highlights the main solutions developed to realise a new decentralised grid operation concept that is compatible with a classic operation scheme. The field test was one of the main demonstrators in the EU-funded project DREAM."}]}
