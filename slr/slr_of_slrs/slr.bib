 abstract = {The impacts of health information technologies (HITs) on care quality have become a major concern in health care industry. However, pertinent review studies focusing on hospital-related settings are few in numbers. To this end, the authors conducted a systematic literature review in the latest published literature indexed in two electronic databases (i.e., CINAHL Plus and MEDLINE) to identify such impacts on four major areas: health care timeliness and effectiveness, care providers/patients adherence and their perceived care quality. Data drawn from 20 eligible articles were synthesized in this review. In total, 11 studies (55%) showed positive effects of HITs on care quality, six (30%) showed mixed or limited effects, two (10%) showed no effects, and one (5%) showed negative effects. Future works to explore the underneath reasons why HITs lead to certain outcomes should be done to improve our understanding in this field.},

 abstract = {Universities and higher education institutes continually create knowledge. Hence it is necessary to keep a record of the academic and administrative information generated. Considering the vast amount of information managed by higher education institutions and the diversity of heterogeneous systems that can coexist within the same institution, it becomes necessary to use technologies for knowledge representation. Ontologies facilitate access to knowledge allowing the adequate exchange of information between people and between heterogeneous systems. This paper aims to identify existing research on the use and application of ontologies in higher education. From a set of 2792 papers, a study based on systematic mapping was conducted. A total of 52 research papers were reviewed and analyzed. Our results contribute key findings regarding how ontologies are used in higher education institutes, what technologies and tools are applied for the development of ontologies and what are the main vocabularies reused in the application of ontologies.},

 abstract = {A systematic review of the scientific literature in a specific area is important for identifying research questions, as well as for justifying future research in said area. This process is complex for beginners in scientific research, especially if you have not developed skills for searching and filtering information, and do not know which high-level databases are relevant in their field of study. The method proposed leads the researcher from "My" to "The" current state of the problem; we propose an adaptation of the method by Kitchenham and Bacca, which divides the process into three sub-parts: planning, conducting and reporting results. From the approach of the research problem in the preliminary phase research questions (recommended between 3 to 5) and "mentefacto conceptual" is drawn; this last one gives originality to the method and facilitates the development of the thesaurus for searches and inclusion and exclusion criteria. Early research requires doing a basic systematic study to identify work done to review the literature in the area and, if any is found, to verify if those results yield an answer to our research questions. As part of planning the search process, general and specific inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined, along with some complementary inclusion and exclusion parameters. The method followed with rigor, returns to the researcher a list of impact journals in the study area, and a detail of articles that are related to each category of the research questions. A study case has been considered as a guide to expose each of the phases of the methodology in a practical way, with results that support the proposal.},

Lots of these initiatives, however, have been conceived to address the shortage of professionals in the technology sector, an approach that is encouraged by the software industry. On the contrary, this article argues that the focus should swift towards computational thinking, an ability that goes far beyond computer science or technology, fostering fundamental skills for the citizens of the twenty-first century. In this paper we summarize the findings of recent investigations that study computational thinking from different perspectives, explaining what this new skill is made of, presenting outcomes of school interventions showing relationships between the development of this ability and improvements in different subjects and soft skills, presenting technologies to foster its development, and reviewing tools that support educators in the assessment of this skill.},

 abstract = {Process mining allows analysts to exploit logs of historical executions of business processes to extract insights regarding the actual performance of these processes. One of the most widely studied process mining operations is automated process discovery. An automated process discovery method takes as input an event log, and produces as output a business process model that captures the control-flow relations between tasks that are observed in or implied by the event log. Various automated process discovery methods have been proposed in the past two decades, striking different tradeoffs between scalability, accuracy and complexity of the resulting models. However, these methods have been evaluated in an ad-hoc manner, employing different datasets, experimental setups, evaluation measures and baselines, often leading to incomparable conclusions and sometimes unreproducible results due to the use of closed datasets. This article provides a systematic review and comparative evaluation of automated process discovery methods, using an open-source benchmark and covering twelve publicly-available real-life event logs, twelve proprietary real-life event logs, and nine quality metrics. The results highlight gaps and unexplored tradeoffs in the field, including the lack of scalability of some methods and a strong divergence in their performance with respect to the different quality metrics used.},

Such a vision requires, among other things, seamless authentication, data privacy, security, robustness against attacks, easy deployment, and self-maintenance. Such features can be brought by blockchain, a technology born with a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. In this paper, a thorough review on how to adapt blockchain to the specific needs of IoT in order to develop Blockchain-based IoT (BIoT) applications is presented. After describing the basics of blockchain, the most relevant BIoT applications are described with the objective of emphasizing how blockchain can impact traditional cloud-centered IoT applications. Then, the current challenges and possible optimizations are detailed regarding many aspects that affect the design, development, and deployment of a BIoT application. Finally, some recommendations are enumerated with the aim of guiding future BIoT researchers and developers on some of the issues that will have to be tackled before deploying the next generation of BIoT applications.},

It drew the attention of researchers to examine ways to minimize the bullwhip effect. Bullwhip effect occurs because of incorrect company planning in pursuit of customer demand. Bullwhip effect occurs due to increased amplitude of demand variance towards upper supply chain level. If the product handled is a perishable product it will make the bullwhip effect more sensitive. The purpose of this systematic literature review is to map out some of the variables used in constructing mathematical models to minimize the bullwhip effect on food supply chains that have perishable product characteristics. The result of this systematic literature review is that the authors propose an appropriate optimization model that will be applied in the food supply chain sales on the train in Indonesian railways in the next research.},

Under this program, one of the most important issues is an efficient management of the related inventories, including the work-in-process inventories, standard items, and the customized items, which can ultimately contribute to a profitable business for the companies who have launched MC. This paper, therefore, focuses on reviewing the mass customization based literature and identifying various methods to effectively manage inventory for MC schemes. In addition to regular inventory management, with the increasing emphasis on corporate social responsibility, MC companies are required to devote more effort to the proper management of leftover and returned inventories under MC. This paper, hence, examines MC inventory management in both forward and reverse logistics. Findings from this review provide a guideline to operations managers on inventory management improvement in their MC operations. Future research opportunities related to MC inventory management, such as supply chain coordination and risk management, are discussed.},

It is understood that personalization is a controllable variable for successful e-commerce. However, previous research on personalization proposed diverse concepts from numerous fields. As a result, it leads to bias construct of e-commerce personalization development and evaluation by academia and industry. To address this gap, a study was conducted to unravel personalization features from various perspectives. A Kitchenham's systematic literature review was used to discover personalization research from Q1/Q2 journals and top conference papers between 2012-2017. A theory-driven approach was administered to extract 21 selected papers. This process classifies personalization features into four dimensions based on three characters i.e objective, method, and user model. They include architectural, relational, instrumental and commercial dimensions. The results show that instrumental and commercial personalizations have been proved as the most popular dimension in the academic literature. However, relational personalization has been consistently rising as a new interesting topic to study since the massive growth of social media data.},

 abstract = {Maturity models (MM) have been introduced, over the last five decades, as guides and references for the information system management in organizations from different sectors of activities. In the education sector, MM have also been used to evaluate higher education institutions (HEI) in several dimensions, such as ICT, management, process management, course curricula, course/HEI accreditation, e/m-learning, online courses and pedagogical strategies. The HEI have an enormous complexity due to the specificity and quantity of their processes, demanding capable information systems (IS) and tools to manage these IS. Based on the guidelines of a methodology for a systematic literature review, the MM of different subareas of education are identified and categorized in this paper. For each MM associated with HEI IS, it is identified the methodology of development and validation, as well as the scope, stages and their characteristics by dimensions. This study resulted in the need to develop a MM for IS that supports HEI in their core business activities and management.},

 abstract = {Throughout history, software project management issues have been known to negatively affect the software quality and the success of this type of projects. Faced with such issues, some research have proposed solutions to improve the results in software project management in order to contribute significantly to its success. The objective of this paper is to carry out a study of the context of software project management, identifying the management areas that have been intervened with gamification strategies for software process improvement. To this end, this work proposes a systematic mapping as a research method that facilitates the identification of primary studies to analyze information and classify it based on established research criteria. We found 55 primary studies published between 2011 and 2017, on which we performed an information analysis. This analysis highlights the increase in the number of studies that use gamification as an improvement strategy for software project management processes areas. We classified the selected studies by analyzing the type of research method and the type of publication. This analysis shows that it is still an area of research in development and that it is necessary to continue working on the improvement of software project management processes with the aim of contributing to the success of its results.},
